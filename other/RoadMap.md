## Main idea
I want to create a system that will help me to track my time and my progress based on my obsidian workflow that I currently use.

In the project-context folder I added current snippets in the md format. How I take and aggreagte information from different sources.



## Stack
1. Express.js
2. MongoDB or Supabase
3. React.js + Next.js
4. Node.js + Deno2 


## Roadmap

1. Create a backend part of the project, and make sure that it secure and reliable 
2. Intergrade a db and make a simple api to store and retrive data
3. Create a simple frontend to visualize the data
4. 




## Features
1. Time tracking by category
2. Meta learning widger and script 
3. Ai talks based on the notes data  (Kill feature)
4. Google Drive integration
5. Data aggreagation and visulation of the  provided stats by user
